   - Analyzed sales trends over different years and months using SQL queries.
2. **Sales by Temperature Range**
   - Categorized temperature into ranges and analyzed the impact on weekly sales using SQL.
   - Combined the influence of holiday flags with temperature ranges using Power BI.
3. **Store Performance**
   - Calculated total sales by store and identified top-performing stores using SQL.
4. **Influence of Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Sales**
   - Analyzed the relationship between CPI and weekly sales using SQL.
   - Visualized the impact of different CPI ranges on weekly sales using Power BI.
5. **Impact of Holidays and Temperature on Sales**
   - Assessed the combined influence of holidays and temperature on weekly sales using Power BI.
6. **Impact of Unemployment on Weekly Sales**
   - Examined how varying unemployment rates affect weekly sales using Power BI.
7. **Sales Distribution by CPI Range**
   - Visualized sales distribution by CPI ranges using Power BI.
8. **Sum of CPI by Temperature Range and Unemployment Rate**
   - Analyzed the sum of CPI segmented by temperature range and unemployment rate using Power BI.
9. **Average Weekly Sales by Holiday Flag**
   - Calculated and visualized average weekly sales during holidays and non-holidays using Power BI.
10. **Total Weekly Sales by Holiday Flag**
    - Summed total weekly sales based on the holiday flag using both SQL and Power BI.
11. **Sum of CPI by Stores**
    - Aggregated CPI values by store using Power BI.
12. **Average Weekly Sales by Quarters and CPI Range**
    - Analyzed average weekly sales segmented by quarters and CPI ranges using Power BI.
13. **Influence of Unemployment Rate on Weekly Sales**
    - Investigated the effect of different unemployment rates on weekly sales using Power BI.
